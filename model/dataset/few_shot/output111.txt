Over time, these spots may ooze orange, gelatinous spore masses, giving affected berries a damp, slightly sticky texture that sets them apart from the powdery or fuzzy surfaces seen in other strawberry diseases.
cut_img_10122_00000016.jpg On ripe strawberry fruits, small, circular, sunken lesions with tan to dark brown centers develop, often merging into large, water-soaked patches; these spots appear glossy and may ooze orange, gelatinous spore masses in humid conditions, unlike the dry or fuzzy textures of gray mold and leaf spots, and as the disease advances, the fruit tissue collapses and becomes mummified, distinguishing it from nutrient deficiencies or fertilizer damage.
cut_img_10122_00000016.jpg On ripe strawberry fruits, small, water-soaked spots quickly enlarge into sunken, circular lesions with pale pinkish-orange spore masses at their center; these lesions often merge, forming irregular, leathery patches, and the affected tissue appears shrunken and dry rather than fuzzy or soft, clearly distinguishing anthracnose from gray mold or blight.
cut_img_10122_00000016.jpg Strawberry anthracnose disease reveals itself as sharply defined, sunken, oval lesions with pale pinkish centers and dark brown margins on ripening fruit, sometimes exuding sticky orange spore masses; the spots rapidly expand and merge, causing a leathery, shriveled texture, unlike the dry gray fuzz of gray mould or the angular, V-shaped leaf spots of other diseases.
cut_img_10122_00000018.jpg On ripe strawberry fruits, small, sunken, water-soaked lesions emerge, rapidly enlarging into circular, tan to dark brown spots with distinct, depressed centers; these lesions often ooze salmon-colored, gelatinous spore masses in wet conditions, giving the fruit a speckled appearance that distinguishes anthracnose from fuzzy gray mold or dry, surface-only leaf diseases.
cut_img_10122_00000018.jpg On ripe strawberry fruits, Strawberry anthracnose presents as sharply defined, circular, sunken lesions with salmon-pink, gelatinous spore masses gathering in the centers, creating a wet, glossy appearance; these spots expand rapidly, causing the fruit to shrivel and darken, unlike the fuzzy gray mold or dry brown spots of other diseases.
cut_img_10122_00000018.jpg Anthracnose on strawberries is marked by sharply defined, sunken lesions on fruit that appear water-soaked at first, then turn tan with dark, firm borders; as the disease advances, these spots often coalesce into larger, irregular patches with a slightly glossy, leathery texture, sometimes dotted with salmon-pink spore masses！unlike gray mold, there¨s no fuzzy growth, and the sunken pits are a key distinguishing feature.
cut_img_10122_00000041.jpg On ripe strawberry fruit, small, water-soaked lesions appear that rapidly enlarge into circular, sunken spots with pale pink or orange spore masses in their centers; the affected areas develop a firm, slightly leathery texture, and the spots may coalesce, creating large, depressed patches that distinguish anthracnose from gray mould or dry, crusty leaf spots caused by other diseases.
cut_img_10122_00000041.jpg On ripe and unripe strawberry fruits, small, round, water-soaked spots rapidly expand into sunken, dark brown lesions with pinkish-orange spore masses oozing in moist weather; these spots often merge, creating irregular, depressed patches, and unlike gray mould, the surface remains smooth and slick rather than fuzzy or powdery, with fruit tissue eventually collapsing into firm, leathery, shrunken areas as the disease progresses.
cut_img_10122_00000041.jpg On ripe strawberry fruit, small, water-soaked lesions rapidly expand into sunken, circular spots with pale pink to salmon-colored centers, often merging to form large, irregular patches; these spots feel firm rather than mushy, lacking any fuzzy or powdery growth, and the disease visibly advances from the fruit tip inward, frequently resulting in a concentric, bull¨s-eye appearance distinct from moldy or dry lesions of other diseases.
