cut_img_10119_00000045.jpg Strawberry calcium deficiency manifests as small, water-soaked, translucent patches on the fruit¡¯s tip that rapidly expand into leathery, sunken depressions with a papery texture, often bordered by a faint whitish halo; unlike fungal diseases, there is no powdery or fuzzy growth, and leaves remain largely unaffected, making the fruit¡¯s shriveled, dry tip the primary, distinctive marker.
cut_img_10119_00000058.jpg Young strawberry leaves display sharply curled edges with their tips turning dry, brittle, and pale yellow, while the fruit develops small, misshapen, and hard patches at the blossom end that feel leathery rather than soft; these symptoms worsen over time, causing the affected areas to become increasingly firm and sunken, clearly different from the wet or powdery lesions of fungal diseases.
cut_img_10119_00000058.jpg Young strawberry leaves curl inward and develop sharply defined, brittle yellow edges that crack and fragment, resembling scorched lacework, while the fruit tips remain small, hardened, and deformed; this rigidity and fragmented texture distinguish calcium deficiency from the soft, spreading lesions or powdery coatings seen in other diseases, and symptoms remain confined to the newest growth without fuzzy or wet surfaces.
cut_img_10119_00000071.jpg On young strawberry leaves, Strawberry calcium deficiency manifests as sharply defined, irregular yellow patches along the leaf edges, which rapidly turn brittle and curl upward; the tissue often appears papery and dry, unlike powdery or spotted diseases, and margins can become necrotic and collapse inward as the deficiency progresses, distinguishing it from the more diffuse or sunken lesions of other disorders.
