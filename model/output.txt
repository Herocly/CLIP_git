cut_img_10103_00000021.jpg A soft, light brown patch appears on the strawberry fruit, quickly expanding into a watery, sunken area covered in dense, fuzzy gray mold, often causing the berry to collapse and rot.
cut_img_10103_00000025.jpg A soft, brownish patch develops on the side of the ripe strawberry fruit, quickly becoming covered in a dense layer of fluffy, grayish mold that spreads to adjacent berries and partially engulfs the calyx.
cut_img_10103_00000028.jpg A fuzzy, grayish-brown mold blankets the ripening strawberry fruit, often beginning at the calyx and rapidly engulfing the berry with a dense mat of spores, causing the tissue to soften and collapse.
cut_img_10103_00000036.jpg A soft, fuzzy gray coating engulfs ripening strawberry fruits, especially in areas where the berries touch the soil or each other, causing the flesh underneath to collapse into a watery, brown mass.
cut_img_10103_00000052.jpg A soft, light brown patch forms on the strawberry fruit, quickly enlarging and becoming covered with dense, fuzzy gray mold that obscures the skin and seeds, often resulting in a water-soaked, collapsed appearance.
cut_img_10103_00000062.jpg A soft, brownish patch appears on the strawberry fruit, rapidly enlarging and becoming covered with a dense layer of gray, fuzzy mold, often starting at the stem end and progressing to engulf much of the berry¡¯s surface.
cut_img_10103_00000065.jpg A soft, light brown patch forms on the side of the ripe strawberry fruit, quickly expanding and becoming covered with a dense layer of fuzzy, grayish mold that obscures the underlying surface.
cut_img_10103_00000074.jpg A soft, light brown patch with a dense, fuzzy gray coating covers the lower half of the ripe strawberry fruit, causing it to collapse and ooze moisture.
cut_img_10103_00000080.jpg A soft, watery patch develops on the strawberry fruit, quickly becoming covered with a dense, fuzzy gray mold, often starting at the point where the berry touches the soil or another fruit.
cut_img_10103_00000155.jpg A ripe strawberry fruit displays soft, pale brown patches covered with a dense, fuzzy coating of grayish mold, often starting at the stem end and rapidly enveloping the entire berry.
cut_img_10115_00000001.jpg Irregularly shaped brown lesions with sharply defined V-shaped edges appear at the tips or margins of strawberry leaves, often bordered by a lighter yellow halo, giving the foliage a mottled, angular appearance.
cut_img_10115_00000012.jpg Multiple small, dark brown spots with sharply defined V-shaped borders appear near the leaf edges, with the point of the "V" directed inward toward the midrib, often surrounded by a narrow yellow halo.
